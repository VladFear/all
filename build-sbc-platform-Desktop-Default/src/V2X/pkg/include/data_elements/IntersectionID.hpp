/*
 * The IntersectionID is used within a region to
 * uniquely define an intersection within that
 * country or region in a 16-bit field. Assignment
 * rules are established by the regional authority
 * associated with the RoadRegulatorID under which
 * this IntersectionID is assigned. Within the
 * region the policies used to ensure an assigned
 * valueâ€™s uniqueness before that value
 * is reused (if ever) is the responsibility of
 * that region. Any such reuse would be expected to
 * occur over a long epoch (many years).
 *
 * ASN.1 Representation:
 * IntersectionID ::= INTEGER (0..65535)
 * -- The values zero through 255 are allocated for testing purposes
 * -- Note that the value assigned to an intersection will be
 * -- unique within a given regional ID only
